Every journey starts somewhere – and what better place than an honest "hello"?

I'm Chris. Passionate tech nerd, builder by conviction, and someone who simply can't stop creating things that didn't exist before. While others wind down with Netflix in the evening, I'm usually staring at an open terminal, chasing an idea that won't let me go.

## Build. Create. Explore.

I've always been drawn to everything new – new technologies, new concepts, new possibilities. What fascinates me most is pushing the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can actually do in the context of product development. Not on paper, not in polished demos – but in real, working things. Probing the limits, failing, starting over, and ending up with something that simply wasn't there before: that's what makes it worth opening the laptop in the morning.

AI isn't a buzzword to me. It's a tool – the most exciting one I've ever come across as a tech enthusiast. And I'm determined to push it as far as possible, especially when it comes to building products.

## Two Decades of Training and Teaching

Alongside my passion for technology, a large part of my professional life has been shaped by a very different but equally meaningful focus: developing people. For over 20 years I served in the military, with a significant portion of that time spent in training and education. I guided people through their development, passed on knowledge, built structures, and learned what it truly means to not just teach someone – but to empower them.

That time shaped me more than I realized back then. Pedagogy, leadership, responsibility – it sounds like theory, but in a military environment it's hands-on, daily practice. That experience informs everything I do today.

## Why This Blog?

Because I missed sharing.

Over the years I've noticed that the most interesting conversations happen when people talk openly about what actually occupies them – not just the wins, but the detours, the insights, and the questions that still don't have an answer.

That's exactly what I want to do here. I'll write about technology and AI, about product development and what it really takes to bring ideas to life. I'll write about training and learning – because that topic never let me go. And I'll write about what moves me personally: plans, impressions, things I'm currently experimenting with or simply needed to think through out loud.

No filter. No perfectly polished content calendar. Just honest thoughts from someone who has experienced a lot and has even more ahead.

If any of this resonates with you – I'd love to have you along. Write to me, comment, follow, push back. Good conversations rarely happen in monologues.

Welcome to chrisreq.me. Glad you're here.
