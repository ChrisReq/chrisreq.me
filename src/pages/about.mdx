    <p>Hey, I'm Chris – passionate AI user and maker.</p>
    <p>I build things that fascinate me: sometimes tools, sometimes experiments, sometimes just whatever pops into my head.</p>
    <p>AI isn't a buzzword for me – it's a daily tool, and I'm constantly exploring what's possible with it.</p>
    <p>On this blog I share my thoughts, projects, and learnings around AI, technology, and digital entrepreneurship.</p>
